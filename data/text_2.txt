The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built across the northern borders of ancient Chinese states to protect against invasions. It was constructed over several centuries, with the most famous sections built during the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644). The wall stretches over 13,000 miles and is considered one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history.
