Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of cells using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of most food chains.
